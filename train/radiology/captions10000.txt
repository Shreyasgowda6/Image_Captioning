ROCO_60599 Radiation treatment plan illustrating the dosimetric benefits of proton therapy in a patient with tumor near critical central structures. Prescribed tumor dose is 50 GyE in 4 fractions, with isodose line numbers displayed in units of cGyE. Significant radiation sparing of the aorta, esophagus, and lung is achieved due to the steep dose falloff of protons, while achieving appropriate target coverage for tumor cell kill. Beam angles are selected to traverse a minimal amount of lung tissue. Range differences based on the density heterogeneity of tissue traversed can be appreciated at the anterior aspect of the plan, where a peak of dose is deposited in normal lung. Careful attention must be paid to these dose variations and areas of range uncertainty such that dose tolerance of critical structures is not exceeded.

ROCO_20300 Additional diagnostic workup drawn a day prior to the 18F-FDG PET/CT became available showing positive EBV VCA-IgM and negative EBV VCA-IgG indicating acute infectious mononucleosis. CMV-IgM was furthermore positive. HIV and hepatitis panels were negative. Given the patient’s age, the clinical course with no past medical history and acute EBV titers, the patient’s abnormal 18F-FDG PET/CT scan was most likely secondary to acute EBV infection and no lymph node biopsy was performed. The patient was closely monitored. After a week he had resolution of symptoms clinically, ALT had increased to 461 U/L, LDH to 780 U/L. Twenty days after the initial 18F-FDG PET/CT scan the patient was feeling well, he had regained his appetite and returned to daily activities although still complained of tiredness. ALT = 193 U/L, LDH = 295 U/L. At this time both EBV VCA-IgG and EBV VCA-IgM antibodies were positive. CMV IgG was negative and CMV-IgM was borderline indicating a previous false positive CMV-IgM probably induced by the EBV infection. Follow-up 18F-FDG PET/CT scan in the patient performed 7 weeks after the initial scan (Figure 2) revealed complete metabolic response. Except for one lymph node which had decreased in size from 2.0 cm to 1.2 cm, all the other lymph nodes had regressed to normal size on CT. The size of the spleen had normalized (14 cm). ALT and LDH were normal. Reporting of this case is in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee. 18F-FDG uptake in EBV infection has been reported previously in a few cases in children [1] and organ transplant recipients [2]. Only two cases of 18F-FDG uptake in acute adult EBV infection have previously been reported [3,4]. In conclusion, this case illustrates acute adult EBV infection in a non-immunocompromised adult with EBV-induced lymphadenopathy that mimicked malignant lymphoma on 18F-FDG PET/CT scan. It highlights inflammation as one of the most well established causes of falsely interpreting 18F-FDG PET/CT as suspicious of malignancy. Any inflammatory process can demonstrate hypermetabolic activity because of the high degree of glucose metabolism by activated cells of inflammation [5,6]. As always, the benefits of 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnostic work-up should be viewed in light of the radiation burden to the patient.

ROCO_35754 Interstitial syndrome and lung rockets. This figure presents most of the criteria of the B-line (the elementary sign). The B-line is defined using seven criteria, three of which are always present: a comet-tail artefact; arising from the pleural line; moving in concert with lung sliding (when lung sliding is present). The other four criteria are almost always present: long; well-defined; erasing A-lines; hyperechoic. This definition works in all situations and avoids confusion with other comet-tail artefacts that are not B-lines. The resulting sign, lung rockets, indicates that more than two B-lines are visible between two ribs. Three or four B-lines make the pattern called septal rockets and correlate with Kerley’s lines (subpleural interlobular septa). Five or more (the maximum seems to be 10) make a pattern called ground-glass rockets, as they correlate with ground-glass lesions. It is easy to count here six B-lines, a pattern correlating with ground-glass lesions on computed tomography. Lung rockets indicate interstitial syndrome.

The patient must be simulated supine, arms by the side, head resting on neck-shape as per department protocol. A personalised immobilisation mask can be used. Treatment Volume. The fields must cover the whole brain and include the cerebrum and cerebellum. The superior border of the field must be overshooting the skull by 2 cm to ensure adequate coverage. There must be adequate coverage of the intracranial contents by a margin of 1-2 cm. The caudal border needs to be angled to accomplish this and also avoid the eyes. The pituitary is usually included in the field by default. No effort should be made to cover it if it is not in field.
